# Python-Kriging-Climate
Use Kriging to interplation data of Climate with China&amp;Taiwan Area , and also import the backward Trajectory with Hysplit data


Example1 : 
Use PM2.5 data.

Use Hysplit to calculate backward trajectory 72hours from Taiwan-Tamsui,
So PM2.5 data of Taiwan at t time , and PM2.5 data of China at t-3 time.
picture shows that remote transportation of PM2.5's path
