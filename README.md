# Python-Kriging-Climate
Use Kriging to interplation data of Climate with China and aiwan Area , and also import the backward Trajectory.


Example1 : 
Use PM2.5 data.

Use backward trajectory 72hours from Taiwan-Tamsui,
So PM2.5 data of Taiwan at t time , and PM2.5 data of China at t-3 time.
picture shows that remote transportation of PM2.5's path.

Red line and blue line are different AGL(Above Ground Level).
Red is denote 100m , Blue is denote 500m, and each point in the line are 6hours.
